      myth: "Employers can fire anyone at any time without reason.",

      myth: "Overtime pay is only for employees who work more than 40 hours a week.",

      myth: "Cultural leave is not legally required and is just a company perk.",
      truth: "While not explicitly mandated by a specific 'Cultural Leave Act,' denying leave for significant cultural obligations like Kemem or mourning periods can be seen as discriminatory or a breach of good faith employment practices. It's a critical customary practice.",

      myth: "An employee handbook is not a legally binding contract.",
      truth: "This can be false. If a handbook contains specific promises of treatment or disciplinary procedures, courts may interpret it as an implied contract. Disclaimers are important but not always foolproof.",

      myth: "Work permits are the employee's responsibility alone.",
      truth: "False. Employers have a legal obligation to ensure their non-resident workers hold valid work permits and to track their expiration dates. Fines can be levied against the employer for non-compliance.",
